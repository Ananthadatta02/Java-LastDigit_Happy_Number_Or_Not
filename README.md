# Java-LastDigit_Happy_Number_Or_Not
This Java program checks if the last digit of a given number is a Happy Number. It repeatedly replaces the digit with the sum of the squares of its digits until it becomes 1 (Happy) or 4 (Unhappy). It uses a helper method sum() to calculate the square-sum of digits.
